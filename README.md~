# IDC4Android

IDC 4 Android is different from what we used in windows. For example, GetEntryPointQty() described in Enumerating Exported Functions section of THE IDAPRO BOOK will retrive nothing in android OS.


We write these script to verify the useful of these examples and give the alternative scheme if dose not.

BTW, I show some examples when dealing with obfuscator of android.
